Talk to invest.


## 🚀 Problem We Solved
**DeFi investing is complex, fragmented, and intimidating.** Users are forced to jump between multiple dashboards, wallets, and protocols to make even a single investment decision — let alone manage risk or run strategies. Traditional DeFi interfaces are overwhelming to new users, siloed across protocols, and lack intelligence or guidance.
